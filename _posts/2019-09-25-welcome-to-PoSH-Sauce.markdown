This blog is mainly a supplementary to my powershell GitHub repositores. The repositories are a selection of powershell functions and scripts that I've written over the years. The blog side of PoSH Sauce was a good opportunity to take advantage of GitHub pages and to get used to using  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator that powers this blog. Please check out my Powershell repositories on my GitHub page and hope you'll find something to help and inspire your own usage of Powershell.
